For explaining the github workflow, first I will start telling by Branches.
In GitHub branches are 2 types. i) Customer branches ii) Release Branches

customer branch
===============
For each and evry customer we need to maintain a separate branch. That is customer branch.
ex- Lets say, we are developing a common s.w for banking purpose. So if we have 2 customer like sbi & hdfc then for them we will create 2 separate branches form the common code.

Release Branach
===============
For each customer
